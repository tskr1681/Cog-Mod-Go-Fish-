Download the GOFISH_final.zip file, and then unzip it.
Open the unzipped file and open GoFish.xcodeproj file and run it. (set the simulator device as iPhone 11 Pro Max).


Unfortunately we did not manage to get a version of the app working that successfully incorporated the ACT-R model. Therefore the version of the game that is handed in will not have this functionality. Nevertheless we would like to show the work we did on the cognitive modeling including production rules and the thought process behind our integration of ACT-R in Swift. We hope you take a look through our ACT-R model files to see the work we've put into them despite this unfortunate circumstance. As a team we still learned a lot about the process of combining a cognitive model with an App.
